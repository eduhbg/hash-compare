# :hash: MD5 Hash Compare

A basic md5 hash compare.

Hope you enjoy it! ðŸ‘½

## How it works:
It's a basic hash comparison where do you need to put a password that you want to obtain the hash and then put the hashed password that you want to compare. The program returns if the hashes match or not.

#### What is MD5?
*"The MD5 (message-digest algorithm) hashing algorithm is a one-way cryptographic function that accepts a message of any length as input and returns as output a fixed-length digest value to be used for authenticating the original message.*

*The MD5 hash function was originally designed for use as a secure cryptographic hash algorithm for authenticating digital signatures. But MD5 has been deprecated for uses other than as a noncryptographic checksum to verify data integrity and detect unintentional data corruption."*

## What I've learned:
How MD5 works and how is easy to compare the hashes by making a comparison with a list of possibles passwords.
